# Unminify & Minify

A simple and efficient tool for transforming code between **minified** and **readable** formats.
I created this tool because it became frustrating to rely on online minifiers and unminifiers that often fail to load or become slow - forcing me to manually minify or unminify code. This project solves that annoyance by providing a fast, reliable, offline solution.

## Features

* 🔧 **Minify** - Compress code to reduce size and improve performance.
* 🔍 **Unminify** - Expand minified code into a clean, readable format.
* 🚀 **Fast & Lightweight** - Designed for speed with zero unnecessary overhead.
* 📦 **Supports multiple languages** - Works with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more.
* 🖥️ **Easy to use** - Command-line friendly with intuitive usage.

## Use Cases

* Preparing front-end files for production.
* Debugging or understanding minimized third-party scripts.
* Avoiding unreliable online minification tools.
* Cleaning up messy code.
